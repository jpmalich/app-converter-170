# MASTER PRICE CATALOG — FULL DIFF REPORT (2026-07-18)
Workbook: Pro-quotes Master price Catalog.xls (6 tabs). RULE 6 HONORED:
**nothing has been applied** — every item below awaits Howard's go.

## TAB 1 — Vinyl-Ascend (four-tier sell lists, new layout) — DIFF vs price_tiers
78 priced sheet rows parsed · all four tier columns compared (WS / Contractor
/ BD / One-OPP ↔ whole-sale / Contractor / Builder-Dealer / one-opp).

### Price changes: **NONE**
Every matched row is identical to the current DB across all four tiers —
including spot-verified corners: Charter Oak Std/Arch (136.22/151.97
Contractor), B&B one-opp 113.57, coils' one-opp drops (133.23/149.74/145.89),
and the Finish Trim one-opp 0.45/0.49 (sheet and DB agree exactly — noted,
not flagged as delta).

### Adds: **ONE**
| Item | Section | WS / Contr / BD / One-OPP | AMI |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pelican Bay Shake Starter | Pelican Bay Shakes → Siding Accessories | 13.99 / 13.99 / 13.99 / 13.99 | 65516000 |
FLAT across four tiers — CONFIRMED INTENTIONAL by Howard (matches the whole
Pelican Bay section: Shakes 9" also flat 419.94×4). The diff engine treats
flat-tier as-is; no "correction" into tiering. **On approval this clears the
vinyl-conventions ruling-5 pricing-pending.** Profile-specific starter table
confirmed by the sheet: vinyl Starter 107361 · Ascend Starter 107371 ·
Pelican Bay Shake Starter 65516000.

### Removals: **NONE**
All 15 initial no-shows resolved as layout artifacts, verified by AMI:
- Clap variants (Conquest/Coventry/Odyssey/Charter Oak): the sheet's combined
  AMI ranges (e.g. 016061-016062) cover BOTH Clap and Dutch Lap DB rows at
  identical prices — one sheet row = two DB rows. No removals.
- "3/4\" Soffit J-Channel (Charter Oak) Std/Arch" = the sheet's VINYL SOFFIT
  J rows (same AMI 105118, same 5.23/6.03) — DB name carries the Charter Oak
  branding; prices identical. No removal, no rename needed unless Howard wants
  sheet naming.
- ".019 Coil" = sheet ".019 Coil (1 per 5 Sq Siding)" (AMI 103954, identical).

### Flags (report-only)
1. **Pelican Bay Shakes 9" AMI**: sheet 655050 vs DB 655052 — confirm which.
2. Sheet layout places J-channel rows inside B&B / Pelican Bay / Soffit
   sections (same SKU 105118) — corroborates vinyl-conventions ruling (3)
   region/context J lines. No catalog action (SKU already present).
3. Shutters, gable vents, Mitre, Gutter Guard carry no AMI on the sheet —
   DB likewise; no delta.

## TAB 2 — LP SmartSiding-1 (COST LAYER — CONFIDENTIAL) — cross-check vs PIT00003, NOT applied
Sheet header: "SN ALSIDE PITTSBURGH — JANUARY 2025" — this tab is **13 months
older** than the current cost layer (Feb-2026 supplier sheet). Deltas
(sheet-Jan-2025 vs current):

RECOMMENDATION: keep the current Feb-2026 cost layer — the workbook tab
predates it. Flag-not-overwrite honored; leak-scan boundary: this data stays
in the cost layer / this admin report only, never on tier lists or
contractor surfaces.

## TABS 3–6 — diff-report only (per-tab go required)
| Tab | Size | Status |
|---|---|---|
| ISS Remolding Siding price | 61×5 | inventory parsed; no current ISS-remodeling catalog counterpart — would be net-new ingestion. Detailed diff on your go. |
| ISS Window Replacement | 38×7 | same — net-new. |
| Mezzo Price sheet | 105×39 (matrix layout) | large size-matrix; detailed diff on your go. |
| VERO | 21×13 | DB HAS Vero window sections (Double Hung / Sliders / Casement / Picture) — a real diff is possible; produced on your go. |

## TAB 5 note — ISS New Construction
Not in this workbook (per your rule 5) — backlog gate stays open; the
separate sheet is still awaited.
